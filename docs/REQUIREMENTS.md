# üìù Project Requirements ‚Äì GhostEcho 

**GhostEcho** is a privacy-first, real-time one-on-one chat application focused on user control, media handling, and accessibility. This document outlines the planned features, technical scope, and architectural decisions for development.

---

## ‚úÖ Problem Statement

When users send images or videos, recipients should be able to **accept or deny** the media before viewing it. This protects user privacy and ensures they are not forced to see unsolicited content.

---

## ‚ú® Unique Features

1. **Self-Destructing Messages**
   - User-defined timers per message.
   - Inspired by apps like Snapchat, but more flexible and customizable.

2. **Real-Time Speech-to-Text Conversion**
   - Converts voice messages into text automatically.
   - Great for accessibility and quiet/noisy environments.

3. **Media Sharing with Approval**
   - Recipient gets a prompt: ‚ÄúAccept or Reject‚Äù before viewing media.

4. **Fraud & Abuse Prevention**
   - Prevent multiple accounts per user/device.
   - Device fingerprinting, IP detection, OTP validation.
